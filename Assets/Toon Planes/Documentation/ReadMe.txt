Thank you for purchasing Toon Planes!

Version 1.0:

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.

The aircrafts have separated pieces, with centered pivot points. For example, the planes
have separated flaps, ailerons, rudders, elevators and landing gears. The helicopters have
separated rotors and landing gears.

The engine intakes and propellers are also separated and have centered pivots. In addition,
propellers and intake fans have a custom script attached to them that grants you control 
of their rotation (speed and axis of rotation).

The reason for the addition of the script, is that you gain control of the rotation speed 
though code.

Landing gears are animated with takeoff and landing animations. A simple animator has been
setup where applicable, though further editing would probably be needed.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and separated parts on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of the vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”

Each aircraft uses the toon shader, taken from the standard assets folder.
The textures used by the material are very small in size: the diffuse 
texture is 128*128 and the ramp texture is just 128*4.


In addition to the aircrafts, there are some props and particle systems included in the 
package, those were used in the presentation of the package and add to the overall stylized
feeling. Feel free to use them as well.
